# TicTacToe
A fully functional Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It has three modes, playing with another person, playing against an easy bot, and playing 
against a medium bot. The easy bot places its character in a random spot open spot on the board. The medium bot creates a deep copy of the board and places its character in every open spot to check if there is a place where it can win. If there is a spot where it can win, then it places its character at that spot. If there is no spot for it to win, it then places the opponent's character in every spot to check if there is a place where it can lose. If it finds a place where it can lose, it places its character at that spot. If there is no spot where it can win or lose, it places its character in a random open spot on the board. To play, all you need to do is run the Python file and you will need to enter your inputs in the terminal. The code uses error handling to ensure that only valid inputs are entered, and prints a message if an invalid input is entered. Happy playing!!
